
It is crucial to use a training set that is representative of the cases 
we want to generalize to.
This is often harder than it sounds;
if the sample is too small,we will have a sampling noise
(i.e.,nonrepresentative data as a result of chance),but even very large 
samples can be non representative 
if the sampling method is flawed.This is called "sampling bias".

Famous example of sampling bias:US Presiditial Elections 1936 Roosevelt and Landon.
Literary Digest poll 10Million people mail 2.4Million responses.
57%Landon 62%Roosevelt.

-->Poor Quality of data:If the training data is full of outliers,
and noise (due to poor quality measurements),it will make harder for the system 
to detect the underlying patterns.

-->Irrelevant features:Good set of features to train--Feature Engineering

Overfitting - Model performs well on the training data,but it doesnot generalize 
well.
Complex models such as Deep Neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data,
but if the training set is noisy,or if it is too small
(which introduces sampling noise)
then the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself.
Obviously these patterns will not generalize to new instances.

Underfitting:When the model is too simple to learn the underlying structure 
of the data.The main options to fix this problem are :
Selecting a powerful model,with more parameters.
Feeding better features to the learning algorithm.
Reducing the constraints on the model.

To avoid "wasting" too much training data in validation sets, 
a common technique is to use cross-validation.The training set is split
into complimentary subsets and each model 
is trained against a different combinations of 
these subsets and validated against the remaining parts.

Bias and Variance:

Bias :This part of generalization is due to wrong assumptions,assuming linear data which is actuallty quadratic.
A high bias model is most likely to underfit the data.

Variance:This part is due to model's excessive sensitivity to small variations in the training data.
A model with many degrees of freedom(such as high-degree polynomial) is likely to have high varaince.
Which results in overfitting the data.

Ridge Regression Cost function:

J(theta) = MSE(theta) + (alpha)1/2(summation)i=1 to n(theta(i)^2)
alpha is hyperparameter..

(Theta) = (X(transpose).X + (alpha)A)inverse .X(transpose).y
