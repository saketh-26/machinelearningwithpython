Statistics is discipline of Analyzing data.
Descriptive and Inference :
Descriptive : Exploratory Data Analysis,Clustering..
Inference : Making conclusions from samples.
e.g:Counting set of people..
1)Quantitative Data or Numerical
2)Qualitative Data or Categorical

Qualitative Data or Categorical -->Nominal and Ordinal
Provides information about the quality of an object..
e.g:Good,Average or Poor..

Nominal -->No Numeric Value --> Blood Group - ->A,B,O+
        -->Gender male,female..
I cannot perform any of my mathematical operations..
Count can be possible..(Mode)...

Ordinal data-->In addition to possesing properties,it can also be 
naturally ordered.They can be arranged in a sequence of increasing or decreasng order

e.g:Customer Satisfaction -->Good,Not bad,Very Bad,Very Happy..
Grades - A,B,C.

I can also go for count of occurances along 
with Median and quartiles..

Quantitative/Numeric -->Interval,and Ratio..
Numeric data for whichnot have only the order is known but also the exact difference is known..
Intervel data -->Temperature difference ..(Mathematical operations and also the 
central tendency can be measured -->Mean..

Ratio-->Numeric data for which the exact value can be measured.Standard Deviation,Variance,Mean.

Nominal and Ordinal attributes are Discrete.
Interval and ratio attributes are Continuous..

Variance -->(Summation of each value - mean of data)^2

Poisson Distribution:It is used to calculate the number of events that
that might occur in a continuous(fixed) time interval..

For example, in 1946 the British statistician R.D. Clarke published "An Application of the Poisson Distribution," 
in which he disclosed his analysis of the distribution of hits of flying bombs (V-1 and V-2 missiles) in London 
during World War II. 
Some areas were hit more often than others. The British military wished to 
know if the Germans were targeting these districts 
(the hits indicating great technical precision) or if the distribution was due to chance. 
If the missiles were in fact only randomly targeted (within a more general area), 
the British could simply disperse important installations to decrease the likelihood of their being hit.


Clarke began by dividing an area into thousands of tiny, equally sized plots. Within each of these, 
it was unlikely that there would be even one hit, let alone more. Furthermore, under the assumption that the missiles
fell randomly, the chance of a hit in any one plot would be a constant across all the plots.
Therefore, the total number of hits would be much like the number of 
wins in a large number of repetitions of a game of chance with a very small probability of winning. 
This sort of reasoning led Clarke to a formal derivation of the Poisson distribution as a model.


Probability Mass Function:It is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is 
exactly equal to some value.

A discrete variable is a variable whose value is obtained by counting. 
A continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring.

Binomial Distribution : Only two outcomes are possible..

A binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

The experiment consists of n repeated trials.      ---->We flip a coin 2 times
Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure.
---- head or tail
The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial. --0.5 on evert trial
The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.----  getting heads on one trial does not affect whether we get heads on other trials.

Notation :


The following notation is helpful, when we talk about binomial probability.

x: The number of successes that result from the binomial experiment.
n: The number of trials in the binomial experiment.
P: The probability of success on an individual trial.
Q: The probability of failure on an individual trial. (This is equal to 1 - P.)
n!: The factorial of n (also known as n factorial).
b(x; n, P): Binomial probability - the probability that an n-trial binomial experiment results in exactly x successes, 
when the probability of success on an individual trial is P.
nCr: The number of combinations of n things, taken r at a time.

Probability of getting exact 2 fours when a dice is tossed 5 times?

b(x; n, P) = nCx * Ppow(x) * (1 - P)pow(n - x)

b(2; 5, 0.167) = 5C2 * (0.167)2 * (0.833)3    -->0.139

Multinomial Distribution : A binomial experiment is a special case of a multinomial experiment.
Here is the main difference. With a binomial experiment, each trial can result in two - and only two - possible outcomes.
With a multinomial experiment, each trial can have two or more possible outcomes.

Thus it is the probability distribution of the outcomes from a multinomial experiment.

It has the following principles:

The experiment consists of n repeated trials.
Each trial has a discrete number of possible outcomes.
On any given trial, the probability that a particular outcome will occur is constant.
The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.
Consider the following statistical experiment. You toss two dice three times, and record the outcome on each toss. 
This is a multinomial experiment because:

The experiment consists of repeated trials. We toss the dice three times.
Each trial can result in a discrete number of outcomes - 2 through 12.
The probability of any outcome is constant; it does not change from one toss to the next.
The trials are independent; that is, getting a particular outcome on one trial does not affect 
the outcome on other trials.

Multinomial Formula. Suppose a multinomial experiment consists of n trials, 
and each trial can result in any of k possible outcomes: E1, E2, . . . , Ek. 
Suppose, further, that each possible outcome can occur with probabilities p1, p2, . . . , pk. 
Then, the probability (P) that E1 occurs n1 times, E2 occurs n2 times, . . . , and Ek occurs nk times is:

P = [ n! / ( n1! * n2! * ... nk! ) ] * ( p1n1 * p2n2 * . . . * pknk )

where n = n1 + n2 + . . . + nk.

Suppose a card is drawn randomly from an ordinary deck of playing cards, and then put back in the deck. 
This exercise is repeated five times. What is the probability of drawing 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs?

Solution: To solve this problem, we apply the multinomial formula. We know the following:

The experiment consists of 5 trials, so n = 5.
The 5 trials produce 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs; so n1 = 1, n2 = 1, n3 = 1, and n4 = 2.
On any particular trial, the probability of drawing a spade, heart, diamond, or club is 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively.
Thus, p1 = 0.25, p2 = 0.25, p3 = 0.25, and p4 = 0.25.
We plug these inputs into the multinomial formula, as shown below:

P = [ n! / ( n1! * n2! * ... nk! ) ] * ( p1n1 * p2n2 * . . . * pknk )

P = [ 5! / ( 1! * 1! * 1! * 2! ) ] * [ (0.25)1 * (0.25)1 * (0.25)1 * (0.25)2 ]

P = 0.05859

(Gaussian)Normal Distribution :The normal distribution refers to a family of continuous probability 
distributions described by the normal equation.

The Normal Equation. The value of the random variable Y is:

Y = { 1/[ σ * sqrt(2π) ] } * e-(x - μ)2/2σ2

where X is a normal random variable, μ is the mean, σ is the standard deviation, 
π is approximately 3.14159, and e is approximately 2.71828.

The Normal Curve
The graph of the normal distribution depends on two factors - the mean and the standard deviation. 
The mean of the distribution determines the location of the center of the graph, 
and the standard deviation determines the height and width of the graph. 
All normal distributions look like a symmetric, bell-shaped curve

When the standard deviation is small, the curve is tall and narrow; and when the standard deviation is big, 
the curve is short and wide.

An average light bulb manufactured by the Philips lasts 300 days with a standard deviation of 50 days.
Assuming that bulb life is normally distributed, what is the probability that an Philips light bulb will last
at most 365 days?

Solution: Given a mean score of 300 days and a standard deviation of 50 days, 
we want to find the cumulative probability that bulb life is less than or equal to 
365 days. Thus, we know the following:

The value of the normal random variable is 365 days. -x 
The mean is equal to 300 days. - (mean)
The standard deviation is equal to 50 days. (std)

P( X < 365) = 0.90.

Probability Density Function:

Most often, the equation used to describe a continuous probability distribution is called a probability density function .
Sometimes, it is referred to as a density function, a PDF, or a pdf. For a continuous probability distribution, the density function has the following properties:

Since the continuous random variable is defined over a continuous range of values (called the domain of the variable), 
the graph of the density function will also be continuous over that range.
The area bounded by the curve of the density function and the x-axis is equal to 1, when computed over the domain of the variable.
The probability that a random variable assumes a value between a and b is equal to the area under the density function bounded by a and b.

1)Handling Text and Categorical Attributes:

Label Encoder [Convert text labels to numbers]
OneHotEncoder [Cnvert Integer categorical values into onehot vectors] -Multinomial Distribution
LabelBinarizer [both text to integer categories and vice versa]

2)Custom Transformers [fit(),transform() and fit_transform()]

3)Feature Scaling [Get all the attributes in the same scale -->min-max scaling and standardization.

Min-max ->subtracting the min value and dividing by the max minus the min.

Xnew = (X(i) - min(X))/max(X) - min(X)  [Normalization]

Z-Score Normalization -->This is preferred when the data contains outlier.In the presence of outlier,
values move closer to zero as range increases.Z-Score follows the principle of statistics and moves the 
data to mean zero and standard deviation to one.

Z = (X-mean(X))/StdDev(X)

Standardization ->Subtracts the mean value and then divides with the variance (so that the result has 
unit variance),Unlike MinMax scaling,standardization doesn't bound values to a specific range.
Scikit-learn provides a transformer called "StandardScaler"

Train data -->It used for making the model to learn.
Test data -->It is used to validate the model.

4)Transformation Pipelines [many data transformation steps in right order] Pipepline..

Data Quality:Success of machine learning depends largely on the quality of data.
Data which has right quality helps to achieve better prediction and accuracy.

Probabilty = Number of possible outcomes / total number of outcomes..

0 < P(A) < 1 

Probabilty of union of two sets :

Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if they can't happen together.

P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - p(A (intersection) B) 
 
         = P(A) + P(B) as the events are mutually exclusive.

Joint Probability : (Product rule)

P(A,B) = P(A (intersection) B)  = P(A|B).P(B)
